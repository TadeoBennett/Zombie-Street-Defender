# Zombie-Street-Defender
A C++ game made in Qt. This simple graphical game is a modification of my GUI class assignment basic template code. I do not own any music in this game.

All windows are unsizeable.
If you click anywhere on the window of the main game, your player loses focus and therefore the direction buttons(left and right) will not work. Simply click on the player on the window(the soldier image) and this replaces the focus on the player.

Big thanks to Miguel for adding the score count.

AFter downloading the files, run the "Shooter.exe" file
